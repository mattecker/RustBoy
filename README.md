# RustBoy

### FAQ
Q: How do I play a game?

A: Run the following command from the RustBoy root directory:

> cargo run [ROM_name].gb


Q: Is this a high or low-level emulator?

A: A mix of both. Memory and instructions are handled as they would be on a GameBoy, but mathematical operations are done at a high level. This will probably change in the future, as I learn more about the GameBoy's 4-bit ALU.
